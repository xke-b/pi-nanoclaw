## Project Origin and Credit

This repository is a fork of **NanoClaw**.

- Original / upstream NanoClaw repo (credit for the original project vision and architecture): https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw
- This fork (DeepFlame AI group): https://github.com/deepflame-ai/pi-nanoclaw

## What this fork is

`deepflame-ai/pi-nanoclaw` is an **extension fork** of NanoClaw used for customized features for **combustion research** and other activities of the group (e.g., research automation, literature workflows, manuscript preparation, and team ops), while staying close to upstream where possible.

## Pi Coding Agent

This fork is designed to be operated via **Pi Coding Agent** (the CLI + skill system):

- Pi Coding Agent source: https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent

## Quick Start

1) Install **Pi Coding Agent** (see upstream instructions here):
- https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent

2) Clone this repo and start Pi in the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepflame-ai/pi-nanoclaw.git
cd pi-nanoclaw
pi
```

3) Inside the `pi` prompt, run the setup skill:

- `/skill:setup`

Pi Coding Agent will guide you through dependencies, authentication, container/runtime setup, and service configuration.

> **Note:** Commands prefixed with `/` (like `/skill:setup`, `/add-whatsapp`) are Pi Coding Agent skills. Type them inside the `pi` CLI prompt, not in your regular terminal.

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files and no microservices. If you want to understand the full NanoClaw codebase, just ask Pi Coding Agent to walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker) and they can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for the individual user.** NanoClaw isn't a monolithic framework; it's software that fits each user's exact needs. Instead of becoming bloatware, NanoClaw is designed to be bespoke. You make your own fork and have Pi Coding Agent modify it to match your needs.

**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that it's safe to make changes.

**AI-native.**
- No installation wizard; Pi Coding Agent guides setup.
- No monitoring dashboard; ask Pi what's happening.
- No debugging tools; describe the problem and Pi helps fix it.

**Skills over features.** Instead of adding features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase, contributors submit pi skills like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

**Best harness, best model.** NanoClaw runs on the Pi Coding Agent SDK inside each container. This keeps the runtime lightweight and fully hackable while preserving tool-driven customization.

## What It Supports

- **Multi-channel messaging** - Talk to your assistant from WhatsApp, Telegram, Feishu (CN), Discord, Slack, or Gmail. Add channels with skills like `/add-whatsapp`, `/add-telegram`, or `/add-feishu`. Run one or many at the same time.
- **Isolated group context** - Each group has its own `CLAUDE.md` memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted to it.
- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every group is completely isolated
- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run Pi agents and can message you back
- **Web access** - Search and fetch content from the Web
- **Container isolation** - Agents are sandboxed in Docker Sandboxes (micro VM isolation), Apple Container (macOS), or Docker (macOS/Linux)
- **Agent Swarms** - Spin up teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks
- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills

## Usage

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):

```
@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
```

## Customizing

NanoClaw doesn't use configuration files. To make changes, just tell Pi Coding Agent what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Bob"
- "Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"
- "Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"
- "Store conversation summaries weekly"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

The codebase is small enough that Pi can safely modify it.

## Contributing

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (under `.claude/skills/` — `.pi/skills/` is a symlink in this fork) that teaches Pi Coding Agent how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

### RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd like to see:

**Communication Channels**
- `/add-signal` - Add Signal as a channel

**Session Management**
- `/clear` - Add a `/clear` command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires triggering compaction programmatically via the Pi agent session APIs.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- Anthropic-compatible API key (or other Pi-supported provider credentials)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## Architecture

```
Channels --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Pi Coding Agent) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Channels are added via skills and self-register at startup — the orchestrator connects whichever ones have credentials present. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with filesystem isolation. Only mounted directories are accessible. Per-group message queue with concurrency control. IPC via filesystem.

For the full architecture details, see [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md).

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` - Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation
- `src/channels/registry.ts` - Channel registry (self-registration at startup)
- `src/ipc.ts` - IPC watcher and task processing
- `src/router.ts` - Message formatting and outbound routing
- `src/group-queue.ts` - Per-group queue with global concurrency limit
- `src/container-runner.ts` - Spawns streaming agent containers
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - Runs scheduled tasks
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite operations (messages, groups, sessions, state)
- `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` - Per-group memory

## FAQ

**Why Docker?**

Docker provides cross-platform support (macOS, Linux and even Windows via WSL2) and a mature ecosystem. On macOS, you can optionally switch to Apple Container via `/convert-to-apple-container` for a lighter-weight native runtime.

**Can I run this on Linux?**

Yes. Docker is the default runtime and works on both macOS and Linux. Just run `/skill:setup`.

**Is this secure?**

Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full security model.

**Why no configuration files?**

We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize NanoClaw so that the code does exactly what they want, rather than configuring a generic system. If you prefer having config files, you can tell Pi to add them.

**Can I use third-party or open-source models?**

Yes. NanoClaw supports any Pi-supported provider endpoint. Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

This allows you to use:
- Local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with an API proxy
- Open-source models hosted on [Together AI](https://together.ai), [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai), etc.
- Custom model deployments with Anthropic-compatible APIs

Note: The model must support the Anthropic API format for best compatibility.

**How do I debug issues?**

Ask Pi Coding Agent. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach that underlies NanoClaw.

**Why isn't the setup working for me?**

If you have issues during setup, run `pi` then `/debug`.

**What changes will be accepted into the codebase?**

Only security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements will be accepted to the base configuration. That's all.

Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.

This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.
